# study-group

We are a diverse group of software engineering and data science professionals from industry and academia. 

Inspired by the [collaborative culture of artificial neural network research](https://www.untapt.com/industry/2016/08/02/deep-learning-study-group/), we hold regular, chilled beverage-enhanced study sessions in midtown Manhattan. At these meetings, we summarise prescribed preparatory material and leverage our individual strengths in computer science, mathematics, statistics, neuroscience, and venture capital to cement our comprehension of concepts and to implement effective deep learning models.

Over the course of our sessions, we follow three parallel paths: 

1. **Theory**: We study academic textbooks, exercises, and coursework so that we command strong theoretical foundations for neural networks and deep learning. Broadly, we cover calculus, algebra, probability, computer science, with a focus on their intersection at machine learning. 
2. **Application**: We practice deep learning in the real world. We typically commence by collectively following tutorials then we move on to solving novel and illustrative data problems involving a broad range of techniques. In addition to incorporating deep learning into our respective academic and commercial applications, we commit code to the present, public repository where possible. 
3. **Presentations**: Study group members regularly share their progress on Deep Learning projects and their area of expertise. This elicits novel discourse outside of the relatively formal paths **1** and **2**, playfully encouraging along serendipity.

## Application

Our applications have involved a broad range of neural network architectures built largely in Python with [NumPy](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/study-group/tree/master/nn-from-scratch), TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

*With a desire to remain intimately-sized, our study group has reached its capacity. If you'd like to be added to our waiting list, please contact the organiser, [Jon Krohn](https://www.jonkrohn.com/contact/), describing your relevant experience as well as your interest in deep learning. We don't expect you to necessarily be a deep learning expert already :)*
